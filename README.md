### How to keep this repository clean

* DON'T commit files that are specific to your development environment or process
* DO your work in feature branches
* DO oberserve issues in JIRA
* DO delete local and remote feature branches after merging
* DO rebase frequently to assimilate to changes

### How to work with your feature branches

***Assign JIRA ticket to yourself, create one if necessary.***

***Create local feature branch from develop branch.***

    git fetch
    git checkout develop
    git pull
    git checkout -b <your-developer-id>-<issue-name>
    
***Work on your local branch and commit them.***

***Rebase frequently and resolve conflicts.***

    git fetch origin
    git rebase -i origin/develop
    
***Repeat both previous steps until feature is complete and passed all tests. Share/Push your branch.***

    git push origin <your-developer-id>-<issue-name>
    
***Let someone else review your changes and merge your feature branch with the develope branch. Keep track of your actions in JIRA***
    
### How to review feature branch

***Get the Code***

    git fetch
    git checkout <your-developer-id>-<issue-name>
    git pull
    
***Review Code and test it***

***If feature is finished merge it with develope***

    git fetch
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff origin/<your-developer-id>-<issue-name>
    git push
    
***Close JIRA issue***

### How to release

***Create new release branch from develope branch***

    git fetch
    git checkout develop
    git pull
    git checkout -b release-<release-id>
    
***Bump version***

***Commit new release***

    git commit -a -m "Release version <release-id>"
    
***Put Release into master***

    git fetch
    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff release-<release-id>
    git tag -a <release-id>
    git push
    
***Put new version into develop***

    git fetch
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff release-<release-id>
    git branch -d release-<release-id>
    git push
    
## Initial setup
Before you can deploy our application you need to create a few files to fill in necessary information.
To make it easier for you we created several example files, which you can use as a template.
Here is a list of those files:

    ./gradle.properties.example
    ./src/main/resource/oidc/properties.example
    ./src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/persistence.xml.example
  
As you already saw in persistence.xml we are using MySQL. You need to setup a MySQL-Server. To do you can use following provided MySQL-Script:

    ./otherResources/mysql/create_db.sql
